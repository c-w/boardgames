Tasty pieces of sushi are passing by on the conveyor belt: will you manage to grab the yummiest items before anyone else and assemble the top scoring plate?</p> <h2 id="how-is-the-game-played">How is the game played?</h2> <p>Sashimi Express takes place over three rounds. In each round, you are presented with a selection of cards. Everyone picks one card at the same time and then the conveyor belt advances: your neighbor on the right now picks from your cards and you pick from your left neighbor&#39;s cards. This process is repeated until all cards are picked at which point every player&#39;s selection of sushi is scored, the plates are cleared and the next round starts: are you ready to grab more tasty snacks?!</p> <h2 id="what-food-items-are-available">What food items are available?</h2> <p>There are 5 categories of foods in Sashimi Express: nigiri, rolls, appetizers, specials and desserts. To set up a game, assemble a menu by picking as per the suggestions below:</p> <ul> <li>1 type of rolls</li> <li>3 different appetizers</li> <li>2 items from the specials</li> <li>1 dessert</li> <li>all the types of nigiri are always included in every game</li> </ul> <p>You can view the rules for each card in the sections below or by right-clicking on the card during the game.</p> <h3 id="nigiri">Nigiri</h3> <h4 id="egg">Egg</h4> <p>A simple tamago nigiri.
