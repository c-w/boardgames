# Sashimi Express

> いらっしゃいませ Irasshaimase!

Welcome to Sashimi Express, a drafting card game for 2 to 8 players. Tasty pieces of sushi are passing by on the conveyor belt: will you manage to grab the yummiest items before anyone else and assemble the top scoring plate?

## How is the game played?

Sashimi Express takes place over three rounds. In each round, you are presented with a selection of cards. Everyone picks one card at the same time and then the conveyor belt advances: your neighbor on the right now picks from your cards and you pick from your left neighbor's cards. This process is repeated until all cards are picked at which point every player's selection of sushi is scored, the plates are cleared and the next round starts: are you ready to grab more tasty snacks?!

## What food items are available?

There are 5 categories of foods in Sashimi Express: nigiri, rolls, appetizers, specials and desserts. To set up a game, assemble a menu by picking as per the suggestions below:

- 1 type of rolls
- 3 different appetizers
- 2 items from the specials
- 1 dessert
- all the types of nigiri are always included in every game

You can view the rules for each card in the sections below or by right-clicking on the card during the game.

#### Uramaki

With rice on the outside, you will want to eat these as quickly as possible so that your fingers don't get sticky! Some uramaki come with 3 pices, others with 4 and some even with 5 pieces.
